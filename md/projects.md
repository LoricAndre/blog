This is a non-exhaustive list of my (public) projects :

- [OneTerm.nvim](https://github.com/LoricAndre/OneTerm.nvim) is a neovim plugin integrating many cli and tui tools in neovim through a floating terminal and providing an extensible framework for integrating more tools. It is a rewrite of a previous project of mine: [FZTerm.nvim](https://github.com/LoricAndre/FZTerm.nvim)
- Of course, my [dotfiles](https://github.com/LoricAndre/dotfiles) are available on gihub
- You can also find my [neovim config](https://github.com/LoricAndre/nvim_conf), centered around [neovim-lsp](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) and OneTerm and built on [Yet Another Neovim Config (yanc.nvim)](https://github.com/LoricAndre/yanc.nvim) get running with a complete configuration that you can customize through modifying a single file.
