## Welcome !

This site is meant to be a collection of my projects and thoughts about different topics, including vim/neovim, linux, cybersec, scripting and programming languages and other random, possibly non-tech, matters.

The goal is to post at least once a week. This site itself is one of my [projects](projects.html), written using common GNU/posix-compliant tools. It's as simple as possible (the scripts and makefile are currently under 100 SLOC), using pandoc to translate from markdown to html.

Feel free to give feedback, rant or ask questions at contact[at]loric.eu
