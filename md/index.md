## Welcome !
This is my blog where I'll post (when I'll feel like it) about random events or subjects. You'll probably see articles about linux, neovim, my matrix and email servers and other random topics.
<br>
This site itself is one of my [projects](./projects.html) and will probably be the topic of one of the first posts, that I will link here for those interested in how it works.
<br>
Feel free to give feedback, rant or ask questions at contact@loric.eu
