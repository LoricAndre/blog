Hi everyone! (well probably no one for now)

This is my first post, so let's make it about this very blog.

First off, it is built using pandoc, and interfacing it with bash and make.  
Concretely, that means that I'll write my post on my local machine, then git-push it and (eventually, I still have to look up git hooks) it should automatically pull, compile and install it on the server (which is a free tier Oracle instance).

The goal here it to write down about any topic I want to, and if it can help or entertain someone that's a nice bonus. 

While I'm here, my first rant will be about KDE, that get me so angry with its monitor management and random autostarts that I actually booted my windows in order not to have to deal with it, and now I'm writing this in VSCode (well VSCode is objectively pretty good on any powerful enough PC, and as an extra bonus it immediately detected my WSL files). 

WSL brings me to another rant: Why is APT so poorly managed, at least on Ubuntu ? There are way too many outdated packages in the main repos. Pandoc obviously comes to mind since I'm using it for this very post, but I remember noticing other issues.

After all this random ranting, my conclusion is :

<center>`All Hail the mighty pacman !` </center>
